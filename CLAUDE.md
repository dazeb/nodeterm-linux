# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**Node-based terminal manager** (BUSL-1.1, converts to MIT after 4 years — see `LICENSE`): multiple real terminals live on a single
pan/zoom canvas as draggable nodes. Target users are people with ADHD / disorganized
workflows who benefit from a spatial layout over stacked tabs. Long-term vision includes
remote access and paid features — the architecture is built so those slot in without a
UI rewrite (see Transport abstraction below).

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # deps + rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI (postinstall hook)
npm run dev        # dev mode with renderer HMR
npm run build      # production build into out/
npm start          # preview the production build (electron-vite preview)
npm run typecheck  # tsc for both node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
npm run rebuild    # re-run electron-rebuild for node-pty if you hit ABI/native errors
```

`npm test` runs the vitest suite (unit + integration; the remote e2e suites skip when the
companion server repo isn't checked out). `npm run typecheck` is the fastest correctness gate.

## Process model (Electron, three contexts)

The codebase is split by Electron process boundary — keep code on the correct side:

- **`src/main/`** — Node/Electron main process. The **shell** around `src/core/`: owns
  Electron/window/IPC wiring, dialogs, and the `CorePlatform` implementation
  (`platform-electron.ts`). The renderer must never import these.
- **`src/core/`** — Electron-free service core (pty, workspace/settings stores, git,
  chat driver, hook server + hooks cluster, context/subagent tails, transcripts,
  model-window, license, context-link, and the pure ssh leaves under `src/core/remote-ssh/`
  — control-master, remote-git). Talks to its shell ONLY via the `CorePlatform` interface
  (`src/core/platform.ts`); importing `electron` (or `../main/*`) inside `src/core` is
  forbidden and enforced by `src/core/no-electron.test.ts`. The Electron implementation is
  `src/main/platform-electron.ts`. This is the seam the Server Edition's `src/server/` shell
  plugs into.
- **`src/server/`** — Server Edition shell (Phase 2): plain `node:http` + `ws`
  serve the built renderer to a browser and speak a WS-RPC protocol
  (`src/shared/rpc.ts`) that a browser-side `window.nodeTerminal` shim
  (`src/renderer/bridge/`) consumes. Boots the same core services via
  `ServerPlatform` (`src/server/platform-server.ts`). Single-user auth
  (scrypt + httpOnly cookie + Origin check). `npm run server:dev` to try;
  docs/SERVER.md for details. `src/server` must not import electron or
  `src/main` (enforced by `src/server/no-electron.test.ts`). **Phase 3a** also
  serves fs/git/commit handlers (editor/diff/source-control now work in the
  browser) plus a web folder/file picker (in-app server-directory browser,
  replacing the native dialog) and WS backpressure; the renderer detects the
  bridge in `src/renderer/main.tsx` (desktop preload path is untouched).
  **Phase 3b** boots the loopback **hook server** (`hookServer.start()`) + installs
  the managed hook scripts, and `wireAgentStatus` (`src/server/agent-status.ts`)
  broadcasts `agent:status` / `agent:subagent-activity` / `context:update` over the
  bridge, so agent-status badges, subagent cards, and the context meter now work in the
  browser (transcript-path jailed against forged POSTs). Still deferred: the SDK **chat
  node**; **canvas-control** (`agent:control`) is not wired.
- **`src/preload/`** — the only bridge. `index.ts` uses `contextBridge` to expose a
  narrow API on `window.nodeTerminal` (typed in `index.d.ts`). `contextIsolation` is on,
  `nodeIntegration` off.
- **`src/renderer/`** — React UI. Talks to main *only* through `window.nodeTerminal`.
- **`src/shared/`** — types and IPC channel names imported by all three sides. `ipc.ts`
  is the single source of truth for channel strings; never hardcode a channel elsewhere.

PTY output flows main → renderer over per-session channels (`pty:data:<sessionId>`),
input flows renderer → main over `pty:write`. node-pty is kept **external** in the bundle
(`externalizeDepsPlugin` in `electron.vite.config.ts`) because it's a native module.

## Key abstraction: TerminalTransport

This is the load-bearing design decision. The renderer depends only on the
`TerminalTransport` interface (`src/renderer/terminal/transport.ts`), never on IPC or
node-pty directly. The current implementation is `LocalTransport` (IPC → node-pty). A
future `RemoteTransport` (WebSocket to a remote agent) implements the same interface, so
remote access / paid tiers can be added without touching the canvas or terminal UI. When
adding terminal-session features, extend the interface — do not reach around it.

## State & persistence model

**React Flow is the single live source of truth** for nodes. There is intentionally no
separate store mirroring node state — earlier dual-source designs caused sync bugs.
`src/renderer/state/workspace.ts` holds only pure helpers: the color palette, the node
factories (`createTerminalNode`, `createAgentNode(agentId, …)`, `createStickyNode`, `createGroupNode`,
`createEditorNode`, `createDiffNode`, `createChatNode`), the group transforms (`groupSelectedNodes`,
`ungroupNodes`, `duplicateNode`), and the `nodeStatesToFlow` / `flowToNodeStates`
serializers. Node kinds: `terminal | sticky | group | editor | diff | chat`. A node's `data`
carries `title, color, group, tags, collapsed, expandedHeight, shell, cwd, text,
initialCommand, filePath, diffStaged`, `agentId` (which agent CLI a terminal node runs —
persisted), `chatSessionId` (resume id for a chat node — persisted), and `accountId` (which
managed Claude account a terminal/chat node runs under — immutable, resolved at creation, persisted;
see **Managed Claude accounts**). `nodeStatesToFlow` defaults a missing `kind` to `terminal` for backward compat and
migrates the legacy `tags:['claude']` marker to `data.agentId = 'claude'`.

Persistence has two layers:

- **Layout + config**: schema v3. `workspace.json` (in `app.getPath('userData')`) is now an
  **index**: local folder projects are refs to `<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json` (the source of
  truth — git-shareable, machine-portable; pretty-printed, portable `./` node cwds, monotonic
  `rev`), SSH projects are refs to the same file on the server (offline `cache` in the index,
  reconciled by rev on connect, mirrored via `SshFs` with a 5 s write throttle), cwd-less
  canvases stay inline. The renderer contract is untouched: `workspace.load()/save()` still
  speak an assembled v2-shaped `Workspace`; all fan-out lives in `core/workspace-store.ts` +
  pure `core/workspace-files.ts`. v2 files migrate on first save (backup `workspace.v2.bak`,
  one-time renderer note). Outside edits (git pull/sync) are detected by
  `core/workspace-watcher.ts` → silent reload, or a Reload/Keep-mine conflict bar when dirty.
  Unreadable refs render as greyed **unavailable** tabs (never dropped); corrupt project files
  are set aside as `project.json.corrupt-<ts>`. "Open folder…" adopts an existing
  `.nodeterm/project.json` (fresh project id on collision; node ids — tmux names — kept).
- **Live terminal sessions** (tmux): terminals continue where they left off across node
  remounts *and* full app restarts, including running processes. See below.

`settings.json` is a separate store (`main/settings-store.ts`, `state/settings.ts`).

## Projects (tabs)

Each project is one canvas/page; terminals and notes belong to a project. The `projects`
zustand store (`renderer/state/projects.ts`) holds project metadata + the *serialized* nodes
of all projects. **React Flow remains the single live source of truth for the *active*
project's nodes only.** The contract:

- The active-project effect in `Canvas.tsx` (keyed on `activeProjectId`) loads that project's
  serialized nodes into React Flow. `loadingRef` suppresses dirty-marking during this load.
- Before any project switch / add / delete, `commitActiveToStore()` serializes the live
  React Flow nodes back into the store, so nothing is lost. Then disk is written.
- Switching away unmounts the old project's `TerminalNode`s → their tmux clients detach but
  the sessions keep running; switching back reattaches. tmux session names are per-node-id
  (globally unique), so projects never collide.
- The tab caret menu's **Close project** (`closeProject`) is **non-destructive**: it sets
  `project.closed = true` (hidden from the tab bar, kept on disk with all nodes) and leaves the
  tmux sessions running, so closing just detaches like a project switch. Closed projects are
  reopenable from the **"Recently closed"** list on `WelcomeScreen` (`reopenProject` → restores
  nodes, which reattach warm or cold-restore). `hasProjects` counts only **open** projects, so
  closing the last open one shows the welcome screen. **Permanent** deletion (`deleteProject`:
  `transport.destroy(nodeId)` per terminal + drop agent status + SSH teardown) now only happens
  via the `×` on a "Recently closed" entry.
- A project's `cwd` (folder picker, `dialog:select-folder`) is passed to terminal/Claude
  node factories so new terminals open there. **Folder ↔ project is deduped:** "Open folder…"
  reuses the existing project with that `cwd` (and its nodes) instead of creating a duplicate.

## Terminal session continuity (tmux)

`src/main/pty-manager.ts` runs each terminal inside a persistent tmux session
(`tmux new-session -A -D -s nt-<nodeId>`) on a dedicated socket (`-L node-terminal`) with
a generated config (`-f <userData>/tmux.conf`, so the user's `~/.tmux.conf` never
interferes; status bar off, mouse on, 50k history). Because the tmux *server* outlives the
app, sessions survive when no client is attached.

Lifecycle, by intent:
- **Node unmount (project switch)** → the RENDERER **parks** the terminal (`TerminalNode.tsx`
  `parkedTerminals`): the xterm instance + its attached PTY stay alive with the `.xterm` element
  detached from the DOM, so a remount within `TERM_PARK_MS` (5 min) re-adopts them — instant, and
  exact (the tmux client never detaches, so mouse-tracking/alternate-screen modes and scrollback
  carry over; do NOT "optimize" this into a respawn+redraw — a fresh xterm on a reused client
  misses the attach-time mode sequences and breaks scrolling). The park timer then runs the real
  teardown: `kill()` detaches the PTY client; the tmux session keeps running. WebGL contexts are
  released on park / reacquired on adopt (browsers cap ~16 live contexts). Permanent-delete paths
  call `disposeTerminalOnUnmount(id)` so a deleted node disposes instead of parking.
- **Window close / app quit** → clients detach (`PtyManager.killAll()`); the tmux session keeps
  running. `killAll()` deliberately does NOT kill sessions.
- **Node reopen / app relaunch** (nothing parked) → a new PTY attaches to the same
  `nt-<nodeId>` session and tmux redraws current state.
- **User clicks ×** → `destroy(persistKey)` runs `tmux kill-session`, permanently ending it.

The node id is the `persistKey` (passed to `transport.create`), so it must stay stable.
If tmux is unavailable, `PtyManager` falls back to a plain shell (no cross-restart
continuity). `findTmux()` resolves an absolute path because GUI apps don't inherit the
shell PATH; `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` are stripped from the child env to avoid nesting refusal.

### Cold restore (machine reboot)

tmux only survives an **app** restart — a **machine reboot kills the tmux server**, so every
`nt-<nodeId>` session is gone. To bridge that, `create()` returns `PtyCreateResult` with a
`fresh` flag: it runs `tmux has-session` *before* spawning, so `fresh=false` means a warm
reattach (tmux redraws) and `fresh=true` means a cold start (first open OR post-reboot). On a
cold start the renderer (`TerminalNode.tsx`) reconstructs state instead of relying on the dead
session (you can't keep a live OS process across a reboot):
- **Scrollback replay** — `main/scrollback-store.ts` keeps a byte-capped (`256 KB`) snapshot of
  each tmux session's recent output under `<userData>/terminal-scrollback/`, refreshed on a
  timer (`SCROLLBACK_SNAPSHOT_MS`) + on detach/quit (`tmux capture-pane -e`). On a cold start the
  renderer reads it via `pty.readScrollback` and writes it back into xterm (with a "session
  restored" separator). Warm reattach skips it (tmux already redraws). Deleted with the node in
  `destroySession`.
- **Agent resume** — on a cold start of a node whose `agentId` is in `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, the
  renderer re-launches the agent CLI: `resumeCommand(agentId, sessionId)` (from the session id
  persisted in `agentStatus` localStorage — `claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `gemini
  --resume`) when known, else the bare `launchCmd`. The one-shot `data.initialCommand` still wins
  on the very first open, so the agent is never double-launched.

## Terminal node lifecycle (gotchas)

`src/renderer/nodes/TerminalNode.tsx` is the trickiest file:

- The xterm instance + PTY session are created once in a `useEffect(…, [])` and torn down
  on unmount. The component persists across re-renders because React Flow keys nodes by
  `id` — never change a node's id, or you'll respawn its terminal.
- **React StrictMode is deliberately not used** (`main.tsx`) — double-mount would spawn
  two PTYs per node.
- The xterm container is `nodrag nowheel`; a transparent **hover-guard** overlay sits on top
  until you dwell `settings.panHoverDelay` (so quick drag = move node, scroll = pan). After
  the dwell the guard is removed and xterm takes input. The header stays draggable.
- A `ResizeObserver` drives `FitAddon.fit()` + `transport.resize`. Canvas zoom is a CSS
  transform, so it does *not* change `clientWidth` — cols/rows stay stable across zoom.
  `scale-fix.ts` patches xterm's mouse coords so text selection stays aligned when zoomed.

## Node kinds (all rendered by React Flow custom nodes)

- **terminal** (`TerminalNode.tsx`) — xterm + tmux (see above). Header: collapse, color,
  click-to-rename title, ✦ AI-name, ×. Body has a **hover guard** overlay: dwell
  `settings.panHoverDelay` (default 600 ms) before the terminal takes focus — before that,
  drag = move node, scroll = pan canvas. **Cmd/Ctrl+M** (while hovered) toggles a markdown
  render of the captured output. Tag chips via `NodeTags`.
- **Agent** (`createAgentNode(agentId, …)`) — a terminal preset that runs an agent CLI as its
  `initialCommand` (runs once on open via `transport.write`, then cleared), with `data.agentId`
  set. Builtins (`claude`/`codex`/`gemini`) come from `AGENT_CONFIG` (clay color etc.).
  Agent nodes get extra behavior **gated by the
  agent's capabilities** (see **Agent support** below): a busy/working badge + unread dot +
  completion notification + session-name chip (hook-capable agents), content search, and the
  Claude-only **Branch conversation** action. Custom user-defined agents spawn + show
  process/terminal-title status only.
- **sticky** (`StickyNode.tsx`) — colored note, free text, collapsible. Has link handles:
  connect a sticky to any terminal node to attach the note as context (see Context Link).
- **group** (`GroupNode.tsx`) — real React Flow parent/child frame; `groupSelectedNodes`
  reparents children (`parentId` + `extent:'parent'`, relative positions), `ungroupNodes`
  restores absolute. `nodeStatesToFlow` sorts parents first (React Flow requirement).
  Visually: a dashed rounded frame in the group color with a floating label pill (color dot
  + editable name) on the top border and ungroup/× top-right (on hover/selected). The
  `NodeResizer` line is hidden (`lineStyle` transparent) so it can't draw a sharp-cornered
  box; the selection ring is a `box-shadow` instead, which follows the same `border-radius`.
- **editor** (`EditorNode.tsx`) — Monaco code editor for a `filePath`; reads/writes via
  `fs:read`/`fs:write`, auto-detects language from the path, ⌘S saves, dirty dot. A
  **Preview / Edit** toggle (or ⌘M while hovered) renders the live content as markdown.
  **Image files** (png/jpg/gif/webp/bmp/ico/svg/avif) skip Monaco and show an `<img>`
  preview instead — read as base64 via `fs:read-binary` into a `data:` URL (CSP allows
  `img-src data:`), on a checkerboard backdrop with the pixel dimensions in the header.
- **diff** (`DiffNode.tsx`) — Monaco diff editor; `diffStaged` chooses HEAD↔index (staged)
  vs index↔working (unstaged) via `git:show-file` + `fs:read`. Read-only.
- **chat** (`ChatNode.tsx`) — SDK-driven Claude chat (not a PTY). A main-process driver
  (`main/chat-driver.ts`) holds one long-lived `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `query()` per node
  (streaming input, `includePartialMessages`); `main/chat-events.ts` reduces SDK messages to
  `ChatEvent`s pushed over `chat:event:<nodeId>`, consumed by the renderer store
  `state/chatSessions.ts` (+ pure `chatSessionsCore.ts`). Token streaming, in-chat permission cards
  (`canUseTool` bridge — Allow / Always-this-session / Deny), send-while-working FIFO queue
  (driver-side `chat-queue.ts`) + Stop (`interrupt()`), thinking blocks, slash popup (from `init`
  `slash_commands`), image paste/drop (base64 blocks), Edit/Write diff cards (click → diff node), and
  a cost chip (`total_cost_usd` accumulation). Continuity is **resume-based** via persisted
  `data.chatSessionId` (the process dies with the app; history reloads from the transcript via
  `chat.readTranscript`); the driver survives project switches and is disposed only on permanent
  delete paths. Forkable from a Claude terminal node via its header 💬 action (experimental). Agent
  status (RUNNING / NEEDS YOU) is fed from the driver's hooks as `NormalizedAgentEvent`. Claude-only
  via `CHAT_CAPABLE` / `canChat`.

Monaco is wired in `renderer/editor/monaco-setup.ts` (language workers bundled via Vite
`?worker` — no CDN; CSP `worker-src` allows them). Markdown rendering is shared in
`renderer/lib/markdown.ts` (`marked` + DOMPurify sanitize).

## Agent support (Claude / Codex / Gemini / custom)

The app is a pluggable multi-agent system: Claude Code is one builtin of
several. Extra terminal-node behavior is driven per agent by a registry + capability lists, a
shared 4-state model, and a **transient** zustand store `state/agentStatus.ts`
(`{state, agentId, unread, session, sessionId, loop}` per node id; the live `state` is **not**
persisted — only `unread`/`session`/`sessionId` go to localStorage under
`nodeterm.agentStatus`, migrated once from the legacy `nodeterm.claudeStatus` key).

- **Agent registry + capabilities** — `src/shared/agents/config.ts` holds `AGENT_CONFIG`
  (claude/codex/gemini: id, label, spawn command, color, …) keyed by an **open** `AgentId`
  type (so custom ids fit). Capabilities are membership lists, not flags:
  `AGENT_HOOK_TARGETS`, `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`, `RECURRING_CAPABLE`,
  `BRANCH_CAPABLE`, `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE`, `USAGE_CAPABLE`, `CHAT_CAPABLE`,
  `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE`, with helpers (`hasHooks`,
  `canBranch`, `canContextLink`, `canChat`, `hasPermissionMode`, …). Branch, the usage indicator, the
  SDK **chat node** and the permission mode stay **Claude-only** purely by being in only `BRANCH_CAPABLE` /
  `USAGE_CAPABLE` / `CHAT_CAPABLE` / `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE`; **Context Link** now spans the three builtins
  (`CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE = claude/codex/gemini`) (see the `chat` node kind above). UI gates
  on these helpers — no hardcoded `=== 'claude'`. **Custom agents** (user-defined in Settings, `customAgents`) are in
  no capability list: spawn + terminal-title + process status only.
- **Permission mode** (agents in `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE`, Claude-only) — the mode a session
  **starts** in (`claude --permission-mode <mode>`; Shift+Tab still cycles it at runtime).
  `settings.claudePermissionMode` (global, default **`auto`** — a behavior change for existing
  users, who previously got a prompt per action) is overridden per project by
  `project.defaultPermissionMode` (persisted to `.nodeterm/project.json`, so a `bypassPermissions`
  override travels to everyone who clones the repo — the tab menu warns). Modes are
  `manual | auto | acceptEdits | plan | bypassPermissions`, labelled once in
  `PERMISSION_MODE_LABELS` (from which `ALL_PERMISSION_MODES` is derived — the dropdown and the
  validator can't desync). `resolvePermissionMode(project, settings)` is the resolver
  (`renderer/state/permissionMode.ts` `activePermissionMode()` binds it to the live stores), and
  **`withPermissionMode(cmd, agentId, mode)` is the single funnel through which every agent-node
  launch site appends the flag** (new node, cold-restore resume, Branch, handoff/transfer,
  explain-commit, add-agent, canvas-control open-agent + team spawn). UI: Settings → Agents, and
  the tab ⌄ menu for the per-project override.
  **Security:** mode values come from hand-editable, git-shared JSON and end up interpolated into
  a shell command line (tmux `send-keys`), so `permissionModeFlag` **re-validates** the mode at the
  interpolation site (the type is compile-time only) — an unrecognized mode yields **no flag**, i.e.
  the bare, safe command. `'manual'` likewise yields no flag, reproducing the pre-feature command
  bit-for-bit. **Not** covered yet: the SDK **chat node** (`core/chat-driver.ts` still hard-codes
  `permissionMode: 'default'`).
- **State via each agent's hooks → shared 4-state model** — detection uses the agent's own
  hooks, **not** output parsing. `src/shared/agents/normalize.ts` has per-agent normalizers
  (`normalizeClaude`/`normalizeCodex`/`normalizeGemini`) that map each agent's native hook
  events to a `NormalizedAgentEvent` over the shared `AgentState` (`working | waiting | blocked
  | done`) plus subagent/recurring/session kinds. Canvas's listener consumes
  `NormalizedAgentEvent` from `agent:status`, drives the `agentStatus` store, fires throttled
  (5s/node) background notifications, and records the session id. Header shows a pulsing
  **RUNNING** (working) / **NEEDS YOU** (waiting/blocked) badge.
- **Hook server (loopback HTTP)** — `src/main/agents/hook-server.ts` is a main-process
  loopback HTTP server (per-session bearer token, fail-open) that the installed hook scripts
  POST to; it replaced the old `fs.watch` signal-log mechanism. `buildPtyEnv` injects the
  node id + endpoint/token into each spawned session's env; because tmux sessions **outlive
  the app**, the server also writes `<userData>/hook-endpoint.env` so a relaunched main
  process re-advertises the same endpoint (restart handoff). A `setRawListener` channel feeds
  the per-node context-window meter (`context-tail.ts`) and subagent live-transcript
  (`subagent-tail.ts`) for claude.
- **Hook installers** — `src/main/agents/hooks/` holds per-agent hook services + an installer
  registry `MANAGED_HOOK_INSTALLERS`. `managed-script.ts` builds the POSIX hook script that
  POSTs to the server (env-gated: a no-op in the user's normal terminals, active only in
  sessions nodeterm spawns; the `claude-signals` string is kept as the idempotency marker that
  migrates users off the old hook). claude → `~/.claude/settings.json` and gemini →
  `~/.gemini/settings.json` (shared `install-helper.ts`, merged/idempotent, preserving other
  tools' hooks); codex → `~/.codex/hooks.json` + `~/.codex/config.toml` trust entries
  (`codex-trust.ts` — the hash gates whether codex runs the hook).
- **Unread + notification** — on a busy→idle edge while the window is unfocused
  (`document.hasFocus()`), the node is marked unread (header dot, minimap stroke, project-tab
  dot). If notifications are enabled, `window.nodeTerminal.notify()` → main `app:notify`
  (shown only when `mainWin.isFocused()` is false); clicking it focuses the window and sends
  `app:focus-node` → `Canvas.focusNodeById` (selects + centers, switching projects via
  `pendingFocusRef` if needed). A one-time consent prompt gates notifications; toggle in
  Settings (`notifyOnClaudeDone`). Unread clears on focus/select.
- **Session name ⇄ node title** (agents in `RENAME_CAPABLE`, Claude-only) — two-way sync between a
  node's `title` and the agent's own session name (the name shown in `/resume`).
  - **session → title (read):** the authoritative name lives in the transcript `.jsonl`, not the
    OSC terminal title (`/rename` does **not** update OSC — a known Claude gap — so reading the
    file is the only thing that works after a **resume**). `main/transcript-reader.ts`
    `readSessionName(sessionId)` resolves the session file **strictly by sessionId** (no cwd
    fallback — that would make every Claude node in one folder resolve to the same newest transcript
    and adopt each other's names) and `pickSessionName` returns the latest `custom-title`'s
    `customTitle` (the `/rename` name) else the latest `ai-title`'s `aiTitle` (auto name). Exposed
    over `pty.readSessionName`. `TerminalNode` polls it (~4 s) **only once this node's own sessionId
    is known** and **while the title still auto-tracks** (`data.titleAuto`, default true on agent
    nodes), and adopts it as the `title`. `term.onTitleChange` now feeds the `session` chip only.
  - **title → session (write):** the moment the user renames the node by hand (header rename box /
    ✦ AI-name / sidebar / command palette → all funnel through `applyManualTitle` or
    `renameSession`), `titleAuto` flips to **false** (polling stops overwriting) and the chosen name
    is pushed into the live session as `/rename <name>` via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`, same
    one-way bridge as Branch's `/branch`; works whether or not the node is mounted).
  - The launch command is left bare (no `-n`) — Claude's own name is canonical until the user
    overrides it; `titleAuto` is persisted so an overridden name survives reload/resume.
- **Search** — the command palette (⌘K) matches the session name + tags + `nt-<id>` in the
  hint, and substring-searches each terminal's **visible buffer** (captured via `pty.capture`
  on palette open, cached ~3s); content matches show "found in output".
- **Subagent visualization** (agents in `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`) — `subagent-start`/`subagent-end`
  normalized events (from Claude's `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` on tool `Agent`/`Task`, correlated
  by `tool_use_id`) drive a transient `state/agentNodes.ts` store. Claude launches subagents
  **async by default**: that PostToolUse is only a launch ack (`status:'async_launched'`), NOT the
  end — normalize keeps the card working, the transcript tail keeps streaming, and the real end is
  the `<task-notification>` queued into the parent transcript (sniffed by the context tails →
  synthetic `subagent-end` in `index.ts`; the notification's `UserPromptSubmit` is also not a
  `newTurn`, so it doesn't clear the fan-out). Canvas renders each subagent
  as an **ephemeral** `SubagentNode` (display-only card: type + task + working/done) connected by
  an **edge** to its parent agent node. These ephemeral nodes/edges live outside the React Flow
  `nodes` state (merged only at the `<ReactFlow>` prop), so they're never persisted
  (`flowToNodeStates`) nor in undo/dirty. Fan-out is cleared on the next new turn / session-end /
  node close. (Subagents share the parent's process — no PTY.) Each card shows
  duration/tokens/tool-uses and **expands** (click) to a **live transcript**:
  `main/subagent-tail.ts` resolves the subagent's own transcript file
  (`<…>/<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, matched by `tool_use_id` via the sibling
  `.meta.json`), tails it read-only, formats each line (assistant text + tool calls + results),
  and streams chunks over `agent:subagent-activity` into the store.
- **/loop, /schedule & /cron node** (agents in `RECURRING_CAPABLE`) — detected from the **tools**
  the agent invokes (robust; users often phrase it in natural language so the prompt rarely starts
  with the slash): `PreToolUse` for `Skill` (skill ∈ loop/schedule/cron), `CronCreate` (→ cron,
  label = cron expr · prompt), or `ScheduleWakeup` (→ loop) — plus a `UserPromptSubmit`
  `/loop|/schedule|/cron` prompt-prefix fallback, all surfaced as `recurring` normalized events.
  Sets `agentStatus.loop` ({count, prompt, items, kind}); for in-session `loop` each turn-done
  bumps the count + appends `lastMessage` (schedule/cron run in the background, so they aren't
  counted). Lifetime by kind: `loop` dies with its session; `cron`/`schedule` **outlive turns,
  sessions and app restarts** (`loop` is persisted in the agentStatus localStorage) and are
  cleared by a `CronDelete` `recurring`-end event or the card's own × (dismisses the card only).
  `clearForParent` (new turn) leaves the loop card's dragged position alone. Renders an ephemeral
  **LoopNode** labelled by kind, connected by an edge to the parent, plus a small header badge.
- **Branch conversation** — node action (`IconBranch`, Claude-only via `BRANCH_CAPABLE`): sends `/branch` into the
  existing terminal via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`) and opens a new Claude node that
  resumes the parked original with `claude --settings … -r <ORIGINAL_ID>`. The original id is
  the session id already known from hooks; `lib/claudeBranch.ts` is the fallback that parses
  `pty.capture` output when the id isn't known. The source node stays on the new branch.
- **Context Link** — a node action gated by `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE` (claude/codex/gemini; custom
  agents + plain terminals excluded): drawing an edge between two builtin-agent nodes lets each
  READ the other's context on demand (pull, not push). `src/main/context-link.ts` (+ pure
  `context-link-core.ts`) writes a per-node link file (carrying `agent` + per-entry
  `agentId`/`sessionId`/`accountId`) under `<userData>/context-links/` and a self-contained CLI
  (Electron-as-Node) that parses **all three** transcript formats (claude JSONL / codex rollout /
  gemini event-sourced chat) to print the linked node's transcript / summary / terminal output.
  Codex/gemini paths resolve via the handoff locators (`locateCodex`/`locateGemini` by sessionId);
  claude keeps the hook-fed path + `locateClaude(sessionId, accountId)` fallback (cwd-newest is
  claude-only); Canvas rewrites link files when a linked node's sessionId appears (`linkSessionSig`).
  Discovery is per-agent: claude installs a `get-linked-context` skill; codex/gemini get an
  idempotent marker block (`<!-- nodeterm:get-linked-context:start/end -->`) merged into
  `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` / `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. On connect an idle-gated one-line note is injected
  into each endpoint (claude → skill pointer; codex/gemini → inline CLI command via
  `contextLink.info()`). (Replaced the earlier MCP-based bridge.)
  **Note links:** a sticky note can be connected to ANY terminal node (one-way, sticky →
  terminal). On connect, agent sessions get a one-shot idle-gated push of the note text
  (`buildNotePushMessage`, single-line, truncated at 2000 chars); plain terminals get no
  push (sendText appends Enter — the text would execute). The note's live text also rides
  the link file (`ContextLinkInfo.note`), so Claude reads the current text via the
  get-linked-context CLI (`summary`/`transcript` print it; `list` marks `(note)`). Pure
  edge/push/map logic in `renderer/lib/noteLink.ts`.
- **Managed Claude accounts** (Claude-only) — run several logged-in Claude identities side by
  side by giving each its own config dir. `settings.claudeAccounts` is a list of `ClaudeAccount
  {id, label, email?, host?, pending?, createdAt}` (in `settings.json`; the account **list** is
  config, not credentials). Isolation is **config-dir**, not token storage: a local account's dir
  is `{userData}/claude-accounts/<id>` (`claudeConfigDirFor` / pure `localAccountConfigDir`),
  a **remote** account's is `~/.nodeterm/claude-accounts/<id>` on its `host` (keyed by
  `sshHostKey` = `user@host`; `remoteAccountConfigDir` is `~`-relative for ssh expansion,
  `remoteAccountConfigDirAbs` resolves it against the connection's `remoteHome`). The **claude
  CLI owns login, credential storage, and token refresh** inside that dir — the app NEVER writes
  credentials. On macOS this works because Claude Code **≥ 2.1** scopes its Keychain service per
  config dir (`Claude Code-credentials-<sha256(configDir)[:8]>`, `claudeKeychainService`); on
  < 2.1 one unscoped service is shared → accounts collide, so add-account **warns** (`claude
  --version`, `isSupportedClaudeVersion`).
  - **`data.accountId` (terminal + chat nodes)** — resolved **once at node creation**
    (`resolveNewNodeAccount`: explicit submenu pick → `project.defaultAccountId` → system default
    `~/.claude`), then **immutable** and **persisted** (serializers). `undefined` = system default
    = **bit-for-bit legacy behavior** (no env touched). Inherited by **Branch** and the
    **terminal→chat fork**. A pending (not-yet-logged-in) account resolves to `undefined` until it
    completes.
  - **Env injection** — `pty-manager` sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in the spawn env AND as a tmux `-e`
    (local); for a remote node it emits an **absolute-path** remote tmux `-e` built from the
    connection-cached `remoteHome` (skipped **fail-open** if home is unresolved). `AUTH_ENV_STRIP`
    (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) is deleted from the
    child env so a stray env key can't shadow the account. A **missing** account dir → warn +
    silent system fallback. The **chat driver** passes `options.env` (same `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` +
    strip) to the SDK `query()` **only when an account is set** (else legacy env untouched).
  - **Login flow** — Settings → Accounts → **Add** creates a `pending` account and drops a canvas
    **login node** that runs `claude /login` under the account dir. Main polls the dir's
    `.claude.json` (`LOGIN_POLL_MS` 2 s, up to `LOGIN_TIMEOUT_MS` 5 min) for `oauthAccount.email`;
    on capture the account flips out of `pending` with its email as the default label. Account
    removal cancels any pending wait + `markDirty`.
  - **Hook install** — the managed hook is merged into **each account dir's** `settings.json` at
    add-account **and** at app launch (local, shared `install-helper.ts`) / via
    `RemoteHooks.installIntoAccountDir` (remote), so every identity reports agent status.
  - **Account-aware readers** — transcript resolution is scoped per account (`transcriptRootFor`
    picks the account dir's `projects/`, composite cache key includes `accountId`); the same
    threading runs through the session-name poll, restart handoff, chat transcript read, and
    `ChatPanel`. The **usage indicator** is per account (`claude-usage.ts`: scoped Keychain
    service first, legacy unscoped fallback; popover lists a row per account with **System**
    first; **remote accounts are excluded** — v1 has no remote usage).
  - **Pickers** — New Claude / New Chat expose an account **submenu** (pane menu; flat entries in
    the dock; palette commands; TabBar sets the **per-project default**). A **local** project
    lists local accounts, an **SSH** project lists only accounts whose `host` matches its
    connection; both offer a **System account** option.
  - **Remote accounts (v1 scope)** — selection + login + env injection only; **no usage**, no
    per-account transcript readers beyond env.

## Canvas interaction & panels (`Canvas.tsx` is the hub)

- **Context menus** (`components/ContextMenu.tsx`, portal, icons from `components/icons.tsx`):
  pane right-click = add nodes at cursor (terminal / Claude / sticky / open file) + select
  all + fit; node/selection right-click = group, color, duplicate, align-to-grid, collapse,
  markdown-view (terminals), delete. Actions live in `Canvas.tsx`, operate on `targetIds`.
- **Add menu** = bottom dock (`Dock.tsx`) `+`, mirrored by the pane menu and command palette.
- **Undo/redo**: debounced snapshot of the nodes array on settle (drag/edit), `pastRef`/
  `futureRef` stacks, ⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z + dock buttons. History resets per project load; skipped
  while typing in inputs/terminals.
- **Selection/pan**: box-select on left-drag (`SelectionMode.Partial` — touch to select);
  pan = middle-drag or trackpad two-finger (`panOnScroll`, `zoomOnScroll:false`); pinch
  zoom. Right mouse is free for the context menu.
- **Delete** (Delete/Backspace) opens `ConfirmDialog` before removing selected nodes.
- **Command palette** (`CommandPalette.tsx`): ⌘/Ctrl+K; `Canvas.buildCommands` (create,
  switch project, jump to node by title/tag, open file…).
- **Explorer** (`ExplorerPanel.tsx`, 🗂 / ⌘⇧E): lazy file tree of the active project `cwd`
  (`fs:list`); click a file → opens an editor node; right-click → Copy Path / Reveal.
- **Source Control** (`main/git-service.ts` system `git` + `gh`, `SourceControlPanel.tsx`,
  ⎇): file-level **stage/unstage** (+/−), **discard**, click a file → **diff node**,
  **branch switch/create**, commit (message box at top) + push / sync / publish, **gh
  sign-in** banner (runs `gh auth login` in a new terminal via `initialCommand`), recent
  commits. **AI commit message** (✦ Generate) and **AI terminal naming** both use
  `main/commit-message.ts`: a BYO local agent CLI (claude/codex/custom) spawned read-only on
  the staged diff / captured terminal output (no built-in model); agent + extra prompt in
  Settings.
- **Settings** (`SettingsPage.tsx`, ⚙ / ⌘,): font/cursor (live to xterm + Monaco), default
  shell, grid + snap, pan-hover delay, double-click focus, accent, tmux on/scrollback,
  commit agent, `seenShortcuts`.
- **Shortcuts** (`ShortcutsPanel.tsx`, ? / ⌘/): shown once on first launch (`seenShortcuts`).
- **Welcome** (`WelcomeScreen.tsx`): shown when no projects exist.
- **Window chrome**: macOS integrated title bar (`titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'`); the tab
  bar (`TabBar.tsx`) is the drag region with the `nodeterm` logo + a rounded pill of project
  tabs. Cmd+M is intercepted in `main/index.ts` `before-input-event` (else macOS minimizes)
  and forwarded to the renderer via `app:toggle-markdown`.
- **Theme**: macOS dark palette as CSS tokens in `styles.css` `:root` (`--accent` = systemBlue,
  label/separator opacities, SF font stack). Canvas background is black with dot grid.

## Packaging & auto-update

Built with **electron-builder** (config in the `package.json` `build` block: appId
`com.nodeterm.app`, productName `nodeterm`, mac dmg+zip for arm64 **and** x64, `asarUnpack`
node-pty, output `dist/`). The app icon is generated from the nodeterm mark by
`scripts/make-icon.mjs` (sharp → `build/icon.png`, 1024², gitignored — regenerated by
`make-icon`); electron-builder derives the `.icns`. Scripts: `npm run make-icon`, `npm run dist`
(local **unsigned** arm64 `.dmg` smoke test). Production release signing/notarization and the
update-feed hosting are handled outside this repo.

Auto-update uses **electron-updater** (`src/main/updater.ts`, `initUpdater(win)` from `index.ts`):
runs **only when `app.isPackaged`** (dev = no-op), checks on launch + every 6h, auto-downloads,
forwards the lifecycle (`update-available` / `download-progress` / `update-downloaded` / errors)
to the renderer over IPC. `components/UpdateCard.tsx` shows the strip + **Restart to update** →
`updates.restart()` → `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()`; on `update-downloaded` an OS notification
also fires when the window is unfocused. Exposed via `window.nodeTerminal.updates` (`UpdateApi`).
macOS *silent* self-install requires a signed+notarized build; unsigned builds still surface
the card for a manual download.

**Backend check feed** (`src/main/check.ts`, successor to the static `announcements.json`): the
**main process** calls `GET https://api.nodeterm.dev/v1/check?version=&os=&channel=stable` (so the
renderer CSP stays `'self'`) on launch + every 6h, cached 5 min, returning `{ messages, update }`.
Exposed split over two IPC handlers: `announcements.fetch()` → `messages`, `appUpdatePolicy` →
`update`. `components/AnnouncementBanner.tsx` (stacked above `UpdateCard` under the tab bar in a
`.top-banners` column) shows the newest message the user hasn't dismissed (dismissed `id`s persist
in `localStorage`); `update.mandatory`/`minSupported` flips `UpdateCard` into a blocking required-
update state. The call no-ops under `DO_NOT_TRACK`/`NODETERM_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` or in unpackaged
builds (unless `NODETERM_API_BASE` targets a local server). Schema example:
`docs/announcements.example.json`. **Telemetry** (`src/main/telemetry.ts`) is a separate opt-out
ping to `api.nodeterm.dev/v1/telemetry` (version/OS on launch + daily), gated on
`settings.telemetryEnabled` + the same build/DNT guards; toggle in Settings → Privacy.

## Conventions

- Code comments, UI strings, and identifiers are all in **English**. Match this when editing.
- Path aliases: `@shared/*`, `@renderer/*` (see the tsconfig files / vite config).
- **Subagent model:** when dispatching subagents (implementers, reviewers, etc. — e.g. in
  the subagent-driven-development workflow), use the latest model, **Opus 4.8**
  (`claude-opus-4-8`). This overrides any cheaper-model defaults in a skill's model-selection
  guidance.
- **Three surfaces — design every feature for all of them.** nodeterm now ships on three
  fronts, and a feature is not "done" until you've decided how it behaves on each (even if
  the decision is "not applicable here"):
  1. **Desktop** (Electron) — the primary app (`src/main` + `src/renderer` via the preload).
  2. **Server Edition** (Linux, browser) — `src/server` + the `src/renderer/bridge` shim (see
     the `src/server/` bullet above and docs/SERVER.md).
  3. **Mobile companion** — *nodeterm mobile*, a **separate repo** at `~/projects/nodeterm-ios`
     (SwiftUI + SwiftTerm/Citadel, tmux-integrated, talks the `TerminalTransport`/RemoteTransport
     protocol).

  Practical rules that keep the surfaces in sync:
  - **Put new service/main-process logic in `src/core` behind `CorePlatform`, never inline in
    `src/main`.** That is the seam the Server Edition boots from — logic left in `src/main`
    silently doesn't exist on the server (the `no-electron` tests enforce the boundary, but
    they can't tell you a feature is *missing* server-side).
  - **A feature that touches `window.nodeTerminal` needs a real `src/renderer/bridge`
    implementation, not just a stub** — or a deliberate, documented graceful degrade
    (`E_UNSUPPORTED` + the affordance hidden, like the Electron-only `shell.reveal`). The
    bridge's `satisfies NodeTerminalApi` gate forces you to *declare* every member, but a
    `noopUnsub`/`unsupported` stub compiles fine while doing nothing — decide per member.
  - **Consider whether the mobile companion should surface the feature** over its
    transport/protocol. It's a different repo and stack (Swift), so this is usually a
    follow-up note rather than same-PR work — but flag it so it isn't forgotten.
  When a change is genuinely desktop-only (native menus, auto-update, Keychain), say so; the
  point is to make the call consciously, not to leave the other surfaces to rot.
